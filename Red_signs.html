<li>If the breeder wants you to make a money transfer via Money Gram or Western Union.</li>
<br>
<li>A French bulldog is sold for 1000 or less; especially a Blue or “unique” color Frenchie</li>
<br>
<li>If the breeder suggests meeting somewhere else other than their home. It is important that you meet the breeder at their house so you can get an idea of how he or she is caring for the puppies</li>
<br>
<li>If the breeder is refusing to give you their Kennel and Business name, most likely they are not registered (with the state. Registration is a requirement) they are not abiding to the law of animal control or IRS.</li>
<br>
<li>​Our experience shows that a fully vaccinated (has at least 3 distemper shots) bulldog puppy is best for not only the breeder when he or she is deciding when it’s the right time to show the puppy to potential customers, but also to the customer who is looking to adopt.</li>
<br>
<li>Make sure the puppy has a good appetite, an updated health certificate, and history of vaccinations that were done. If an Ultra sound was done or even x-rays, that is an added plus since it shows that the breeder knows what their organs look like. as well.</li>
<br>
<li>If you are buying a puppy imported from Europe you have to understand that the rabies vaccination is required for all dogs entering the United States. Puppies must not be vaccinated against rabies before they’re 3 months old. So, the youngest that a puppy can be imported into the United States is 4 months old. If you see 8-15 weeks old puppy on your local market imported from Europe it means that this breeder (could be a puppy mill seller) brought this puppy to this country illegally. Feel free to report this activity to Animal control. </li>
